<h1>Guided Practice 7.2</h1>

<p>Consider the computation of</p>

<pre>
(free-vars
  (make-app
    (make-lam
      'x
      (make-app
        'x
        (make-lam
          'y
          (make-app
            'x
            (make-app 'y 'z)))))
    (make-lam
      'y
      (make-app
        'u
        (make-lam
          'z
          (make-app
            'x
            (make-app 'y 'z)))))))
</pre>

<p>Which of the following will appear as calls to free-vars-in-subexp during
this computation?
</p>

<ol>
  <li><kbd>(free-vars-in-subexp (make-app 'y 'z) (list 'z 'y))</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>(free-vars-in-subexp (make-app 'y 'z) (list 'x 'y)) </kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>(free-vars-in-subexp (make-app 'y 'z) (list 'y 'x)) </kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>(free-vars-in-subexp (make-app 'y 'z) (list 'x 'z)) </kbd></li>

</ol>

<h2>ANSWER</h2>

Answer:  1 and 3.  According to the invariant, the first argument to
free-vars-in-subexp is the list of lambda-variables that the expression
occurs inside of.  There are two  occurences of   
 
<pre>
(make-app 'y 'z)
</pre>

<p>in this fredexp.  The first is inside
</p>

<pre>
(make-lam 'x
   ...  
  (make-lam 'y 
    ...)) 
</pre>
and the second is inside

<pre>
(make-lam 'y  
  ... 
  (make-lam 'z 
    ...)) 
</pre>

<p>If we look at the code for free-vars-in-subexp, we see that the innermost
lambda variable always occurs first.  So the right answers are 1
(corresponding to the first occurrence with the lambda variables
listed inside out) and 3 (corresponding to the second occurrence with
the lambda variables listed inside out). </p>
