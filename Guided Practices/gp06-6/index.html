<h1>Guided Practice 6.6: Descendent Trees</h1>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Design a function person-double-name
that takes a Person and returns a Person just like the given one,
except that the Person and all of his descendants have their names
doubled.  For example, </p>

<pre>
(person-double-name
  (make-person "chuck" 
               (list (make-person "alice" empty) 
                     (make-person "bob" empty))))
=
(make-person "chuckchuck" 
             (list (make-person "alicealice" empty) 
                   (make-person "bobbob" empty)))
</pre>

<p>Try doing it by straightforward structural decomposition, and then
try it again using HOFs for the portion of the data that is
represented as a list.  Remember that you will only learn something if
you actually do it yourself.</p>

<strong>Question 2:</strong> Design the following function:

<pre>
;; person-descendant? : Person String -> Boolean
;; GIVEN: a person and a name
;; RETURNS: true iff that person or any of his/her descendants has
;; that name.
</pre>

<pre>
;; EXAMPLES:
;; Given the persons in the lesson:
(begin-for-test
  (check-true (person-descendant? fred "bob"))
  (check-true (person-descendant? chuck "bob"))
  (check-false (person-descendant? chuck "eddie"))
  (check-false (person-descendant? fred "eve")))
</pre>

<p>Try doing it by straightforward structural decomposition, and then
try it again using HOFC.</p>
