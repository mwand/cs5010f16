<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 02</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, September 21, 2015

</p>

<!-- See Google spreadsheet for collected problem sets and TOTs -->


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions that deal
with finite data.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Beginning Student Language to solve the
  problems.  </p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function.  Thus, for problem 1, the top of your
file should say

<pre>
(require rackunit)
(require "extras.rkt")

(provide
  make-editor
  editor-pre
  editor-post
  editor?
  edit
  ) 
</pre>
</p>

<p>This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the
  <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/K9ZHiaPkdh" >Work Session Report for
  PS02</a>.</p>

  <li>(Tiny Text Editor) Do exercise 84 (the function "edit") from
  Part I, section 5.10 of HtDP/2e.

  <p>You are to write a file called <kbd>editor.rkt</kbd> that provides
  the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
make-editor
editor-pre
editor-post
editor?
edit
</pre>

<p>Note: for our purposes, we will consider KeyEvent to be a scalar
data type, which can be decomposed using the Cases strategy. <span
class="">KeyEvent and <kbd>key=?</kbd> are defined in the
2htdp/universe module.  Look in the Help Desk for details.  You will
need to require <kbd>2htdp/universe</kbd> to import
<kbd>key=?</kbd>. The same holds for the regular-expression problem
below.</p>

  <!-- for next time: delete the comment about the regular-expression
  problem  -->

  <p>Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  So be sure that your solution is in the right place
  (<kbd>set02/editor.rkt</kbd> in your private
  <kbd>cs5010f15/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></kbd> repository), and that
  it provides all the functions listed above.  To see if your file is
  in the right place, insert the following line somewhere near the top
  of your file:</p>

  <pre>
(check-location "02" "editor.rkt")
</pre>

 <!-- <p>We will be doing automated testing of your solution.  In order to -->
 <!-- see whether you have correctly provided the indicated functions, load -->
 <!-- a copy of  -->
 <!-- <a href="ps02-edit-tests.rkt" ><kbd>ps02-edit-tests.rkt</kbd></a> -->
 <!-- into your directory and run it.  This  -->
 <!-- file tests only that you have provided all the functions you are -->
 <!-- supposed to.   Make sure your solution passes those tests before you -->
 <!-- turn in your problem set.</p> -->

</li>

<li> This exercise is based on Exercise 111 in HtDP/2e. As in that
exercise, you are to design a set of functions that illustrate the
workings of a finite-state machine for accepting strings that <span
class="new">exactly</span> match
the regular expression <pre>(a | b)* c (a | b)* d (e | f)*</pre> .  So
<kbd>cd</kbd>, <kbd>abcd</kbd>, <kbd>abcbdef</kbd> and
<kbd>aacbadf</kbd> all match, but <kbd>abc</kbd>, <kbd>abdbcef</kbd>,
and <kbd>acbded</kbd> do not.

<p>The legal inputs to the machine are precisely the strings "a", "b",
"c", "d", "e", and "f".  Any other inputs violate the machine's
contract, and its behavior on those inputs is unspecified.</p>

<p>For this problem, you will NOT create any displays.
</p>


<p>  First, perform an information analysis and design the data
  representation for the states of your machine.  You may wish to
  write down a state-transition diagram (like the ones <a
  href="https://www.google.com/search?num=10&hl=en&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1109&bih=698&q=state+transition+diagrams&oq=state-transiti&gs_l=img.1.0.0i33l10.1619.3742.0.6264.14.14.0.0.0.0.108.1368.9j5.14.0...0.0...1ac.Ynu6MrP4nAA"
  >here</a>) to illustrate the meaning of
  your state.  Keep your diagram as simple as possible.  You should
  submit your state-transition diagram either as ascii art in your
  solution file, or as a jpg or pdf (called "fsm.jpg" or "fsm.pdf"),
  created in your favorite graphics 
  program. 
</p>

<p> Then design the following functions and <kbd>provide</kbd> them in
a file named <kbd>fsm.rkt</kbd>

  <pre>
initial-state : Number -> State
GIVEN: a number
RETURNS: a representation of the initial state
of your machine.  The given number is ignored.

next-state : State MachineInput -> State
GIVEN: a state of the machine and a machine input
RETURNS: the state that should follow the given input.

accepting-state? : State -> Boolean
GIVEN: a state of the machine
RETURNS: true iff the given state is a final (accepting) state

error-state? : State -> Boolean
GIVEN: a state of the machine
RETURNS: true iff there is no path (empty or non-empty) from the given
state to an accepting state
</pre>

<p>You will need to provide data definitions for State and for
MachineInput.  Be sure to write an interpretation for each state.
There is no need to write an interpretation for MachineInput, since
the problem is already phrased in terms of strings.

  <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  So be sure that your solution is in the right place
  (<kbd>set02/fsm.rkt</kbd> in your private
  <kbd>cs5010f15/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></kbd> repository), and that
  it provides all the functions listed above.  To see if your file is
  in the right place, insert the following line somewhere near the top
  of your file:</p>

  <pre>
(check-location "02" "fsm.rkt")
</pre>


<!-- <p>As with the other questions in this problem set, we will be doing -->
<!--  automated testing of your solution.  In order to see whether you have -->
<!--  correctly provided the indicated functions, load a copy of <a -->
<!--  href="ps02-regexp-tests.rkt" ><kbd>ps02-regexp-tests.rkt</kbd></a> into -->
<!--  your directory and run it.  This file tests only that you have -->
<!--  provided all the functions you are supposed to.  Make sure your -->
<!--  solution passes those tests before you turn in your problem set.</p> -->

<li> A coffee machine has two items: coffee and hot chocolate.  Coffee
is $1.50, but hot chocolate is $0.60.  A customer may put any sequence
of coins into the machine, and then select an item.  If the customer
has deposited enough money into the machine, and the machine is not
out of the selected item, then the machine will dispense the requested
item.  If the machine is out of the selected item, the machine will
flash "Out of Item".  The customer may also press "change", in which
case the machine will return any unspent money that the customer has
put in during the current transaction.  If none of these apply, the
machine does nothing.

<p>For example, the customer may put three 25-cent pieces into the
machine.  If he then selects the hot chocolate, the machine will
dispense a cup of hot chocolate.  If he tries to select the coffee
instead, nothing will happen.  If the customer then presses "change",
the machine will return the extra $0.15 that he is owed.  The
customer may request "change" at any time, whether or not he has
ordered anything, and we assume that the machine can always make the
required amount of change.</p>

<p>The machine has a container, called the bank, that contains all the
money it has kept from customers' purchases.  The customer's money is
added to the bank only after he or she has successfully made a purchase.</p>

<p>The possible inputs from the customer are given by the following
data definition:</p>

<pre>
A CustomerInput is one of
-- a PosInt          interp: insert the specified amount of money, in cents
-- "coffee"          interp: request a coffee
-- "hot chocolate"   interp: request a hot chocolate
-- "change"          interp: return all the unspent money that the
                             customer has inserted

A MachineOutput is one of
-- "coffee"         interp: machine dispenses a cup of coffee
-- "hot chocolate"  interp: machine dispenses a cup of hot chocolate
-- "Out of Item"    interp: machine displays "Out of Item"
-- a PosInt         interp: machine releases the specified amount of
                            money, in cents
-- "Nothing"        interp: the machine does nothing
</pre>

  <p>You are to write a file called <kbd>coffee-machine.rkt</kbd> that provides
  the following functions:</p>

<pre>
initial-machine : NonNegInt NonNegInt -> MachineState
GIVEN: a number of cups of coffee and of hot chocolate
RETURNS: the state of a machine loaded with the given number of cups
         of coffee and of hot chocolate, with an empty bank.

machine-next-state : MachineState CustomerInput -> MachineState
GIVEN: a machine state and a customer input
RETURNS: the state of the machine that should follow the customer's
input

machine-output : MachineState CustomerInput -> MachineOutput
GIVEN: a machine state and a customer input
RETURNS: a MachineOutput that describes the machine's response to the
customer input

machine-remaining-coffee : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the number of cups of coffee left in the machine

machine-remaining-chocolate : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the number of cups of hot chocolate left in the machine

machine-bank : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the amount of money in the machine's bank, in cents
</pre>

 <!-- <p>We will be doing automated testing of your solution.  In order to -->
 <!-- see whether you have correctly provided the indicated functions, load -->
 <!-- a copy of <a href="ps02-cofee-tests.rkt" -->

 <!-- This file tests only that you have provided all the functions you are -->
 <!-- supposed to.  Make sure your solution passes those tests before you -->
 <!-- turn in your problem set.</p> -->

  <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  So be sure that your solution is in the right place, and that
  it provides all the functions listed above.  You can use
  <kbd>check-location</kbd> to check whether your file is in the right
  place. </p>

    <li>Your space probe to Pluto has just landed.  Here's the situation:
<p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>The probe is a circle, 40cm in diameter.</li>
    
    <li>At every step, the probe can move forward some number of
    steps, or it can rotate 90 degrees either right or left.  The
    probe moves by taking steps of exactly 1 cm.</li>
    
    <li>The Plutonians, anticipating the arrival of our probe, have
    constructed a trap in the form of a
    square with side 347 cm, centered on the origin.</li>

    <li>The probe has landed right in the trap!  It has landed with
    its center at the origin, facing north (up).</li>
    
 
    <li>We will use graphics-style coordinates instead of standard
    mathematical coordinates. That is, when the probe moves north, its
    y-coordinate DECREASES.  So the northernmost wall of the trap
    is at y = -173.5 .</li>
    
    <li>The probe can also sense when it has run into a wall.  If any
    move of the probe would cause the probe to run into the wall of
    the trap, then the probe will move forward until another 1cm
    step would take it past the wall, and then stop.  For example, if
    the probe proceeded north from its initial position, it could move
    only 153 cm, since that puts its northernmost edge at (0, -173),
    and another 1cm step would send it crashing into the 
    wall.</li>

  </ol>
  
  <p>You are to write a file called <kbd>probe.rkt</kbd> that provides
  the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
<span class="strike">initial-probe</span> <span class="new">probe-at</span>: Integer Integer -> Probe
GIVEN: an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate
<span class="new">WHERE: these coordinates leave the robot entirely inside the trap</span>
RETURNS: a probe with its center at those coordinates, facing north.
<span class="new">EXAMPLE: a set of coordinates that put the probe in contact with the
wall is not consistent with the contract.  Note that this means that
the behavior of probe-at in this situation is unspecified; you don't
need to check for this.</span>

probe-turned-left : Probe -> Probe
probe-turned-right : Probe -> Probe
GIVEN: a probe
RETURNS: a probe like the original, but turned 90 degrees either left
or right.

probe-forward : Probe PosInt -> Probe
GIVEN: a probe and a distance
RETURNS: a probe like the given one, but moved forward by the
specified distance.  If moving forward the specified distance would
cause the probe to hit any wall of the trap, then the probe should 
move as far as it can inside the trap, and then stop.

probe-north? : Probe -> Boolean
probe-south? : Probe -> Boolean
probe-east? : Probe -> Boolean
probe-west? : Probe -> Boolean
GIVEN: a probe
ANSWERS: whether the probe is facing in the specified direction.
</pre>

<p>Note: When the specification groups functions as we have done here,
  you need only write down the purpose statement once (as we have done
  here). If your design strategy is the same for all the functions,
  then you only have to write that down once. Of course your
  examples must cover all the functions.</p>

 <!-- <p>We will be doing automated testing of your solution.  In order to -->
 <!-- see whether you have correctly provided the indicated functions, load -->
 <!-- a copy of <a href="ps02-probe-tests.rkt" -->
 <!-- ><kbd>ps02-probe-tests.rkt</kbd></a> into your -->
 <!-- directory and run it.  This file tests only that you have provided -->
 <!-- all the functions you are supposed to.  Make sure your solution -->
 <!-- passes those tests before you turn in your problem set.</p> -->

    <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  Yeah, yeah, you know the drill now.</p>
