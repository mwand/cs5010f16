<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 7</h1>

<!-- Be sure to change the problem set number both in the title and -->
<!-- the h1! -->

<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, October 26, 2015

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, November 2, 2015
at 600pm local time.

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to give you practice using context
arguments and invariants.
</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe, and write
invariants (as WHERE clauses) whenever an argument represents context
information. </p>

<p>You must use DrScheme's HtDP Intermediate Student Language with
  Lambda. Use list abstractions like filter, fold, and map whenever
  they are helpful. As before, you will be penalized for failing to
use these when they are "obviously" applicable. </p>

<p>Note: not everything on this problem set requires the use of
invariants; some may only require generalization.  Part of your task
is to figure out when you need an invariant and when you do not.
Remember, it is the purpose statement that determines whether or not
you need to state an invariant.</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Pi631A0QoO" >Work Session Report for
  PS07</a>.</p> 


<p>As usual, the rubric for grading is <a
href="../Info/master-rubric-public.txt" >here</a>.

<p>The first few problems on this problem set have to do with
outlines. Consider a text in the form of an outline, for example:
</p>

<pre>
1 The first section
1.1 A subsection with no subsections
1.2 Another subsection
1.2.1 This is a subsection of 1.2
1.2.2 This is another subsection of 1.2
1.3 The last subsection of 1
2 Another section
2.1 More stuff
2.2 Still more stuff
</pre>

<p>The point of an outline is to impose a tree structure on a
  document, so it is natural to represent an outline as a tree.  For example,
  the outline above might be represented as:</p>

<pre>
  (list 
    (make-section "The first section"
      (list
        (make-section "A subsection with no subsections" empty)
        (make-section "Another subsection"
          (list
            (make-section "This is a subsection of 1.2" empty)
            (make-section "This is another subsection of 1.2" empty)))
        (make-section "The last subsection of 1" empty)))
    (make-section "Another section"
      (list
        (make-section "More stuff" empty)
        (make-section "Still more stuff" empty))))
</pre>

  <p>using the data definition</p>

  <pre>
;; An Outline is a ListOfSection
;; A Section is a (make-section String ListOfSection)
;; INTERP: (make-section str secs) is a section where
;; str is the header text of the section
;; secs is the list of subsections of the section
</pre>

  <p>We'll call this the <em>tree</em> representation</p>

<p>Another representation of an outline could be as a list with one
  element per section or subsection.  Each element of the list would
  consist of two members: the section number, represented as a list of
  natural numbers, and a string. This would look more like the text
  representation. We call this the <em>flat</em> representation.</p>
  
<p> In the flat representation, the outline above
  would be represented as
<pre>
  (list
    (make-line (list 1) "The first section")
    (make-line (list 1 1) "A subsection with no subsections")
    (make-line (list 1 2) "Another subsection")
    (make-line (list 1 2 1) "This is a subsection of 1.2")
    (make-line (list 1 2 2) "This is another subsection of 1.2")
    (make-line (list 1 3) "The last subsection of 1")
    (make-line (list 2) "Another section")
    (make-line (list 2 1) "More stuff")
    (make-line (list 2 2) "Still more stuff"))
</pre>


<p</p>

<ol>

  <li> Write a data definition for FlatRep.  Be sure that your data
  definition defines exactly the legal flat representations.  Be sure
  to include whatever invariants are applicable.  Remember the rules
  about outlines that you learned in school: section numbers must be
  in order, and you are not allowed to skip any section numbers.

  <p> Then, design and provide the following function: </p>

<pre>
legal-flat-rep? : ListOfLine -> Boolean
GIVEN: a list of lines, like the one above
RETURNS: true iff it is a legal flat representation of an outline.
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>
  Design and provide the following function:

<pre>
tree-rep-to-flat-rep : Outline -> FlatRep
GIVEN: the representation of an outline as a list of Sections
RETURNS: the flat representation of the outline
</pre>

  <p> Deliver questions 1 and 2 as a file named "outlines.rkt." </p>

  </li>

  <li>Design a program that consumes a list of numbers representing
  daily rainfall amounts as entered by a user. The list may contain
  the number -999 indicating the end of the data of interest. Produce
  the average of the non-negative values in the list up to the first
  -999 (if it shows up). There may be negative numbers other than -999
  in the list.  Deliver your program by providing a function called
  <kbd>rainfall</kbd> in a file named <kbd>rainfall.rkt</kbd>. </li>
