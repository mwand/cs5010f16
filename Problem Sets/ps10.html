<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 10</h1>

<p><strong>Out:</strong> Monday, November 16, 2015
</p>

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, November 30, 2015
at 600pm local time.</p>



<hr>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to give you practice with stateful
classes, and pulling and pushing information. It is also intended to give
you practice with reusing code from previous problem sets.
</p>

<p>Please restrict yourself to the language features discussed in
class. You may use state.  You may not use inheritance.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the deliverables and instructions for this problem set
are the same as for Problem Set 09.  As always, you must follow the design recipe, in this case the OO
Design Recipe and deliverables as spelled out in Lesson 9.5 and in <a href="../Info/deliverables.html#oo-deliverables" >deliverables.html</a>. Be sure to sync your
  work and fill out a Work Session Report at the end of every work
  session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Wj0JrNnV3Z" >Work Session Report for PS
10</a>.</p> </p>

<p>Also, starting with this problem set, you may submit your solution
in multiple files. See details below. </p>

<ol>
  <li> Your boss at the toy factory has been taking PDP, and he has
  been persuaded to buy a "framework" from WidgetWorks International.
  The framework was delivered as a file called <a href="WidgetWorks.rkt"
  >WidgetWorks.rkt</a> that provides three interfaces and one
  function, as follows:

  <pre>
(define StatefulWorld<%>
  (interface ()

   ; Widget<%> -> Void
   ; GIVEN: A widget
   ; EFFECT: add the given widget to the world
   add-widget

   ; SWidget -> Void
   ; GIVEN: A stateful widget
   ; EFFECT: add the given widget to the world
   add-stateful-widget

   ; PosReal -> Void
   ; GIVEN: a framerate, in secs/tick
   ; EFFECT: runs this world at the given framerate
   run

    ))

;; Every functional object that lives in the world must implement the
;; Widget<%> interface.

(define Widget<%>
  (interface ()

    ; -> Widget<%>
    ; GIVEN: no arguments
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow at the next tick.
    after-tick          

    ; Integer Integer -> Widget<%>
    ; GIVEN: a location
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow the
    ; specified mouse event at the given location.
    after-button-down
    after-button-up
    after-drag

    ; KeyEvent : KeyEvent -> Widget
    ; GIVEN: a key event
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow the
    ; given key event
    after-key-event     

    ; Scene -> Scene
    ; GIVEN: a scene
    ; RETURNS: a scene like the given one, but with this object
    ; painted on it.
    add-to-scene
    ))

;; Every stable (stateful) object that lives in the world must implement the
;; SWidget<%> interface.

(define SWidget<%>
  (interface ()

    ; -> Void
    ; GIVEN: no arguments
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following a tick.
    after-tick          

    ; Integer Integer -> Void
    ; GIVEN: an x and a y coordinate
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following the specified mouse event at the given location.
    after-button-down
    after-button-up
    after-drag

    ; KeyEvent : KeyEvent -> Void
    ; GIVEN: a key event
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following the given key event
    after-key-event     

    ; Scene -> Scene
    ; GIVEN: a scene
    ; RETURNS: a scene like the given one, but with this object
    ; painted on it.
    add-to-scene
    ))

;; make-world : NonNegInt NonNegInt -> StatefulWorld<%>
;; GIVEN: the width and height of a canvas
;; RETURNS: a StatefulWorld object that will run on a canvas of the
;; given width and height.

</pre>

<p>You are relieved to see that these interfaces are much like the
ones you've been working with.  The difference is that you will run
the objects by creating a StatefulWorld, adding your widgets to it,
and then calling the run method on your world.  You no longer need to
call big-bang yourself.</p>

<p>Your job is to reimplement the toy from problem set 9, but using
the WidgetWorks framework and stateful objects. The specifications are
exactly the same, except that:

<ul>

  <li><kbd>PlaygroundState<%></kbd> inherits from
  <kbd>SWidget<%></kbd> instead of <kbd>WorldState<%></kbd></li>
  

  <li> <kbd> Toy&lt;%&gt;</kbd> inherits from <kbd>
  SWidget&lt;%&gt;</kbd> instead of
  <kbd>Widget&lt;%&gt;</kbd>.</li>

  <li>Since WidgetWorks has comandeered the <kbd>make-world</kbd> function, you
  should provide a function called <kbd>make-playground</kbd> instead.</li>

</ul>

<p>Turn in your solution as a file named "toys.rkt". Put a copy of
  <a href="WidgetWorks.rkt" >WidgetWorks.rkt</a> in the directory with
  your solution.  YOU MAY NOT MODIFY WidgetWorks.rkt IN ANY WAY.  WE
  MAY TEST YOUR SOLUTION WITH OUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION OF <kbd>StatefulWorld<%></kbd>. </p>


  </li>

  <li> Your boss at the toy factory asks you to produce a new toy
  inspired by <a
  href="http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets/" >Cubelets</a>, which are
  square blocks that stick together.  The new toy has the following specification:  

  <ol><p/>

    <li>The toy consists of a canvas that is 600 pixels high and 500
    pixels wide.</li>

    <li>When the child types "b", a new block pops up on the screen
    at the location of the last button-down or button-up.  The block appears as a 20x20
    outline square.  The square is initially green.  If the child
    types a "b" before the first button-down or button-up event, then
    the first block appears in an unspecified but fixed place on the canvas.</li>

    <li>A block does not move by itself, but the child can move it
    around using Smooth Drag.  When the block is selected, it appears
    as red rather than green.</li>

    <li>If a block is dragged so that it contacts or overlaps another
    block, the two blocks become connected.  We say that the blocks
    are <em>teammates.</em>.  The property of being a teammate is
    symmetric and transitive.  So if block A is moved to touch block
    B, then a new team is formed consisting of A and all its
    teammates, and B and all its teammates.</li>

    <li>Two blocks overlap if they intersect at any point.  For this
    purpose, the edges of the block are considered part of the
    block.</li>

    <li>Once two blocks become teammates, they remain teammates forever.</li>

    <li>When a block is moved, all its teammates move along with it.
    If A and B are teammates, and A is dragged in some direction, then
    B moves the same way.</li>

    <li>Only the selected block accumulates teammates.  If A is being
    dragged, and B is a teammate of A, and A's motion causes B to come
    into contact with C, C does not become a teammate of A and B.  In
    the video below, we call the selected block the "leader."  But you
    can drag a team by selecting any block in the team, so the leader
    may be different on different drags.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Here's a demonstration:</p>

    <p><center>
<video src="Videos/10-teammates.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>



  <p>Your solution should be a file named <kbd>cubelets.rkt</kbd> that
  provides the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
<span class="strike">make-playground : -> PlaygroundState
GIVEN: no arguments
RETURNS: a PlaygroundState</span>

make-block : NonNegInt NonNegInt ListOfBlock<%> -> Block<%>
GIVEN: an x and y position, and a list of blocks
WHERE: the list of blocks is the list of blocks already on the playground.
RETURNS: a new block, at the given position, with no teammates
NOTE: it is up to you as to whether you use the third argument or
not.  Some implementations may use the third argument; others may not.

The Block<%> interface extends the SWidget<%> interface with AT LEAST
the following methods:

get-team : -> ListOfBlock<%>
RETURNS: the teammates of this block

add-teammate: Block<%> -> Void
EFFECT: adds the given block to this block's team

<span class="new">block-x : -> Integer
block-y : -> Integer
RETURNS: the x or y coordinates of this block</span>
</pre>

<p>You may put more methods in the <kbd>Block<%></kbd> interface if you so desire.
Remember that a method must appear in the interface if and only if it
is called from outside this object.</p>

  <p>There are several places where information must be disseminated in
this problem, either by pushing or pulling.  Be prepared to identify
these and to discuss your design decisions about each of them.</p>

  <p>As in the problem above, you must use WidgetWorks.rkt .</p>

</li>
</ol>

<strong>DELIVERING YOUR SOLUTION IN MULTIPLE FILES:</strong>  As
you've no doubt noticed, your programs have become longer, and it is
awkward to navigate to a particular definition.  So effective with
this problem set, you may split your solution over multiple files if
you so desire.  Here are some ground rules:

<ul>

  <li>All of the files for both questions must live in the same
  directory, as usual.</li>

  <li>Your directory must include a copy of WidgetWorks.rkt and
  extras.rkt .</li>

  <li>Running the file toys.rkt or cubelets.rkt should run the
  solution to each question.</li>

  <li>You may organize your files in any way that is coherent.  You
  will need to defend your organization at codewalk.  However, we
  recommend an organization like the following:<p/>

  <ul>

    <li>A file named something like interfaces.rkt that contains your
    interfaces, constants, and other data that is needed by multiple
    classes.  </li>

    <li>A file for each class, incuding the unit tests for that
    class.</li>

    <li>A top-level file, named toys.rkt or cubelets.rkt, that
    requires the other files and provides the deliverable functions
    and classes listed with each question.</li>

  </ul>

</li>

</ul>
