<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 26, 2015

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design and use
multiply-recursive and mutually-recursive data definitions, and to
give you practice using the list abstractions and HOFC.
</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe. </p>

<p>You must use DrScheme's HtDP Intermediate Student Language with
  Lambda.</p>

<p>As usual, the rubric for grading is <a
href="../Info/master-rubric-public.txt" >here</a>. Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/XXXXX" >Work Session Report for
  PS04</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs, you may assume
that the mouse is never dragged or moved outside of the canvas.  Once
the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas, then
the behavior of your system is unspecified.</p>
</p>

<h2>Required Exercise</h2>

  In this problem, you will design and implement a system for a
  graphical interface for trees.  Your system will allow you to create
  and manipulate trees on a canvas.  Create a file called "trees.rkt"
  with the following properties: <p></p>

  <ol>

    <li>The canvas starts empty. Its size is 500 pixels wide by 400
    pixels high.</li>

    <li>Nodes of the tree are rendered as green outline circles of a
    fixed radius.  The default value for the radius
    is 10, but your system should allow you to change the radius for
    the next run by changing a single line of your code.</li>

    <li>When the tree is displayed, there should be a straight blue
    line from the center of a node to the center of each of its
    sons.</li>

    <li> You can select a node by clicking on it, as in previous
    problems.  Selected nodes are displayed as green solid
    circles. Clicking on a node selects only the node, not any of its
    subtrees.  If the mouse is clicked in the overlap of two or more
    nodes, all the nodes are selected, even if one node is a son or
    descendant of the other. </li>

    <li> Dragging a selected node causes the entire tree rooted at
    that node to be dragged.  The relative positions of all the nodes
    in the subtree should stay the same.  It is ok if this action
    causes some nodes to be moved off the edge of the canvas; if the
    node is moved again so that they are now back on the canvas, they
    should reappear in the proper place.</li>

    <li> Hitting "t" at any time creates a new root node in the center
    of the top of the canvas. The root appears tangent to the top of
    the canvas and initially has no sons.</li>

    <li> Hitting "n" while a node is selected adds a new son, whose
    center has an x-coordinate that is 3 radii to the right of the
    center of the currently rightmost son, and a y-coordinate that is
    3 radii down from the center of the parent.  The first son of a
    node should appear 3 radii down and directly beneath the
    node. </li>

    <li> Hitting "d" while a node is selected deletes the node and its
    whole subtree. </li>

    <li>Hitting "l" at any time (whether a node is selected or not)
    deletes every node whose center is in the left half
    of the canvas. (If a node is deleted, all of its children are also
    deleted, as with "d")</li>

  </ol> <!-- end requirements list -->

    <p>Here's a small demo.   </p>

<p><center>
<video src="../Videos/ps05.mp4" controls/>
</center></p>

<p>  Your solution should provide the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
initial-world : Any -> World
GIVEN: any value
RETURNS: an initial world.  The given value is ignored.

run :  Any -> World
GIVEN: any value
EFFECT: runs a copy of an initial world
RETURNS: the final state of the world.  The given value is ignored.

world-after-mouse-event : World Integer Integer MouseEvent -> World
GIVEN: a World, a location, and a MouseEvent
RETURNS: the state of the world as it should be following the given mouse event at that location.

world-after-key-event : World KeyEvent -> World
GIVEN: a World and a key event
RETURNS: the state of the world as it should be following the given key event
 
world-to-trees : World -> ListOfTree
GIVEN: a World
RETURNS: a list of all the trees in the given world.

tree-to-root : Tree -> Node
tree-to-sons : Tree -> ListOfTree
GIVEN: a tree
RETURNS: the node at the root of the tree, or its sons.

node-to-center : Node -> Posn
RETURNS: the center of the given node as it is to be displayed on the
scene.
Note: this function returns a Posn (an ISL builtin).  This is for the
convenience of the testing framework, and you may or may not wish to
represent the center of the node in this way.

node-to-selected? : Node -> Boolean
RETURNS: true iff the given node is selected.
</pre>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  
  <li> Follow the design recipe!!  If you write good data definitions,
  and follow the templates, you will be led to a good solution.  If
  you stray from the templates, you <strong>will</strong> create a
  mess.  If you are following your templates and still creating a
  mess, try an alternate path.  For example, if you are doing
  structural decomposition on one data type, followed immediately by
  structural decomposition on another data type, try doing them in the
  other order.</li>

  <li>The specifications talk about Tree and Node, because some
  students may wish to implement these as different data definitions.
  If you wish to represent Trees and Nodes as the SAME data structure,
  that is also permissible. </li>
  
  <li>The built-in abstraction functions, like map, foldr, and filter,
  are your friends.  Use them wherever it is feasible to do so.  As
  before, you may want to write your functions using explicit
  recursions, and then rewrite them using the abstractions and
  higher-order function combination.  You will be penalized for
  recursions in your code that "obviously" could have been replaced by
  HOFC.</li>

  <li>Most likely you will want to use <kbd>scene+line</kbd> from the image
  library rather than <kbd>add-line</kbd>, since the latter changes the
  dimensions of the image in surprising ways.</li>
