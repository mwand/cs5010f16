<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 9</h1>

<p><strong>Out:</strong> Monday, November 9, 2015
</p>

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, November 16, 2014
at 600pm local time.</p>

<hr>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design simple class
systems and methods on them.
</p>


<p>As always, you must follow the design recipe, in this case the OO
Design Recipe and deliverables as spelled out in Lesson 9.5 and in <a href="../Info/deliverables.html#oo-deliverables" ></a> </p>

<ul>

  <li>As part of the data analysis step, you must create a UML class
  diagram that can be displayed during the codewalk. You may either
  create this in ASCII or using your favorite diagramming tool.  If
  you use a tool, you must deliver it in pdf format.  The diagram need
  not be elaborate.  For each class, it should show the class name,
  the interface the class implements, the fields and their types, and
  the methods and their contracts.</li>

  <li>You should have no structs in your solution: every struct should
  be replaced by a class.</li>

  <li>You can treat key events and mouse events as scalar data, as you
  have done in the past.

  <!-- ordinary data -->
  <!-- definitions, and define alternate enumerations (like -->
  <!-- AnimationKeyEvent) as you have in the past. -->

</li>

  <li>Similarly, if you need a list of indefinite length, you can use
  a Racket list (with ordinary data definitions); you do not need to
  turn this into an interface and two classes.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Please restrict yourself to the language features discussed in
class.  In particular, you may NOT use state
or inheritance.</p> 

<p>You must use <kbd>#lang racket</kbd>, <kbd>rackunit</kbd>,
<kbd>"extras.rkt"</kbd>, <kbd>2htdp/universe</kbd>, and
<kbd>2htdp/image</kbd>.  So your file should begin something like

<pre>
#lang racket
(require rackunit)
(require "extras.rkt")
(require 2htdp/universe)   
(require 2htdp/image)      
</pre>

You may require "sets.rkt" if you need it.  You may not
<kbd>require</kbd> any other libraries.

<hr>

<p>You have taken a job in a toy factory.  You job is to simulate the
following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahWcocGtEyA"
>marvelous toy</a>:</p> 

<ul><p></p>

  <li>The toy consists of a canvas that is 600 pixels high and 500
  pixels wide.</li>

  <li>On the canvas, the system displays a circle of radius 10 in
  outline mode.  The circle initially appears in the center of the
  canvas.  We call this circle the "target."</li>

  <li>The child interacts with the toy by dragging the target (using
  smooth drag, as usual) and by typing characters into the system.
  Each of the characters listed below causes a new toy to be created
  with its center located at the center of the target.  Toys are also
  moveable using smooth drag. </li>

  <li>When the child types "s", a new square-shaped toy pops up.  It
  is represented as a 40x40 pixel outline square.  When a
  square-shaped toy appears, it begins travelling rightward 
  at a constant rate.  When its edge reaches the edge of the canvas,
  it executes a Perfect Bounce.
  </li>

  <li>When the child types "t", a new throbber
  appears.  A throbber starts as a solid green circle of radius 5.  At every
  tick, it expands gradually until it reaches a radius of 20.  Once it
  reaches a radius of 20, it contracts gradually until it reaches a
  radius of 5, and then resumes its cycle.</li>

  <li>When the child types "w", a clock appears.  This clock displays
  the number of ticks since it was created.  Otherwise the appearance
  of the clock is unspecified.</li>

  <li>When the child types "f", a Tom Brady Deflatable Football(TM)
  appears. Go out on the net and find an image of a football. The TBDF
  initially appears as an image of a football, but it gets smaller
  with every tick until it reaches size 0.</li>

  <li>As usual, you are not responsible for anything that happens after
  the mouse leaves the canvas.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are many unspecified parameters in the description above.
Choose parameters (like speed, the exact way in which items grow and
shrink, etc.) so that the result is visually satisfying.</p>

<p>I believe this problem is easier than the last one, so have some
fun with it. </p>

<p>Your solution should be a file named <kbd>toys.rkt</kbd>
should provide classes and functions:</p>

<pre>
make-world : PosInt -> PlaygroundState<%>
RETURNS: a world with a target, but no toys, and in which any
square toys created in the future will travel at the given speed (in
pixels/tick). 

run : PosNum PosInt -> PlaygroundState<%> 
GIVEN: a frame rate (in seconds/tick) and a square-speed (in pixels/tick),
creates and runs a world in which square toys travel at the given
speed.  Returns the final state of the world.

make-square-toy : PosInt PosInt PosInt -> Toy<%>
GIVEN: an x and a y position, and a speed
RETURNS: an object representing a square toy at the given position,
travelling right at the given speed.

make-throbber: PosInt PosInt -> Toy<%>
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a throbber at the given position.

make-clock : PosInt PostInt -> Toy<%>
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a clock at the given position.

make-football : PosInt PostInt -> Toy<%>
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a football at the given position.

Interfaces:

(define PlaygroundState<%>
  (interface (WorldState<%>) ;; this means: include all the methods in
                             ;; WorldState<%>. 
    
    ;; -> Integer
    ;; RETURN: the x and y coordinates of the target
    target-x
    target-y

    ;; -> Boolean
    ;; Is the target selected?
    target-selected?

    ;; -> ListOfToy<%>
    get-toys

))

(define Toy<%> 
  (interface (Widget<%>)  ;; this means: include all the methods in
                          ;;  Widget<%>. 
 
    ;; -> Int
    ;; RETURNS: the x or y position of the center of the toy
    toy-x
    toy-y

    ;; -> Int
    ;; RETURNS: some data related to the toy.  The interpretation of
    ;; this data depends on the class of the toy.
    ;; for a square, it is the velocity of the square (rightward is
    ;; positive)
    ;; for a throbber, it is the current radius of the throbber
    ;; for the clock, it is the current value of the clock
    ;; for a football, it is the current size of the football (in
    ;; arbitrary units; bigger is more)
    toy-data


    ))
</pre>


<p>When you do this problem, remember the principle of Iterative
Development: get something simple working, and then add features as
necessary. </p>
