Design a program called rainfall that consumes a list
of numbers representing daily rainfall amounts as entered
by a user. The list may contain the number -999
indicating the end of the data of interest. Produce
the average of the non-negative values in the list up to
the first -999 (if it shows up). There may be negative
numbers other than -999 in the list.
